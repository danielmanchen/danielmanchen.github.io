      began in the fall of 2022. This began as a way to develop a new skill set in an
      area that truly interested me. What ultimately ended up happening was that I developed
      a multitude of other skills. Professionalism is my ability to communicate and
      articulate an idea or question. Perseverance in the face of adversity while
      remaining humble and able to ask for help. Most importantly improved skills in
      analytical problem solving. Every day was a new challenge and being able to
      identify and approach them in a concise systematic manner allowed me to achieve
      everything thus far.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      troubleshooting cutting edge aeronautics systems. I was able to utilize an
      already existing skillset in working through problems faced in the field of computer
      science. Electromechanical systems are comprised of many pieces working
      together to achieve a common goal. Such is the same with software, being able
      to first identify said goal, working backwards to identify key components has
      helped to analyze function and option I received exposure to in all coursework.
      This seems to have benefited myself most in approaching problems related to
      software design and engineering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      integrated systems can lead to breaches of sensitive information which can be completely

      various items. Then present the number of unique items to the user. The user

      Two focuses on the implementation of algorithms and data structures to solve a

      to be a good fit to implement this pathing algorithm to solve a maze in the
      most efficient manner possible. This added feature also provided a second
      benefit as it allowed the program to identify whether or not the maze was solvable.
      Which initially it could not do as it generated obstacles from random numbers.
      By successfully implementing this pathing algorithm the program was able to guarantee
      a maze with a possible solution, on top of identifying the most efficient
      route.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      requires an enhancement <span class=GramE>in regards to</span> a database
      system. Building upon the first enhancement plan, a database has been
      implemented into the inventory management system using MongoDB. Utilizing the
      express framework on the server side and mongoose to interface with the
      database. Essential functionality for the user has been created, allowing for
      new items to be added to the database. Existing item quantities can be <span
      class=GramE>modified</span> and items may be wholly deleted from the system.
      This has greatly <span class=GramE>improve</span> scalability of the overall

      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Wanting to remain
      in the same vein as the original application. I implemented an improved version

      could be directly added to the MongoDB cluster. Probably the most difficult
      part aside from ensuring all the appropriate network connections were
      established to initiate all appropriate CRUD operations. <span
